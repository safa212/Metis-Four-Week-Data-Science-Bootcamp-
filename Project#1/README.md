# Hotel booking demand 
Hotels booking cancelation make it harder to accurately forecast and optimize
occupancy which in turn results in revenue loss. The goal of this project is to
predict in advance weather a hotel customer will cancel his booking or not.
Predicting future booking cancellation can help hotels plan for cancellation and
refund policies, staffing schedules as well as targeting customers with offers and
discounts. It is also important to understand key booking cancellation factors and
how those factors relate to booking cancellation.
